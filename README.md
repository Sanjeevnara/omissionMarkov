MATLAB code used to analyze the data for the paper:

"Automatic and feature-specific prediction-related neural activity in the human auditory system"

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11440-1

Note: this is how it worked for me, on my computer/cluster. It won't work right away for you, it needs a little bit of tweaking of paths etc, so YMMV. I provide it "as is", essentially to let you play around with it, but neither me nor my University could be responsible of what you do.
TL;DR: don't used for clinical purposes.
